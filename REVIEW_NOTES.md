# Your PR Review Notes

1. Start with a short summary. Then add inline comments like `src/CalendarApp/CalendarScheduler.cs:87 → <your comment>`.
2. Review the PR. Call out must-fix blockers vs follow-ups, propose a safe rollout, and list tests you'd add.
3. Create a path that would address the issues you've discovered.
